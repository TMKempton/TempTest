Death is baffled. \"How?\" he asked, his voice still as cold as the day I met him. \"After eons and eons of heartbreak and loss, war and hatred, how are you still in love with life?\" \"It's simple, really.\" I replied, \"You of all people should know of the circle.\" \"The circle!

Their mother had died last week in a territory battle. We don't get those much in the reserve because of the large space and abundant resources, but it still happens. This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest. I knew her hatchlings would be too young to fend for themselves. I found them easily. She hadn't moved them since I stumbled upon them the first time, likely too weak from the cancer.

I toss her over my shoulder and make my way through the house. I watch where I place my feet. A pink bone nearly detonates but I move my foot at the last second.

As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle. Breaking the seal on the letter, I unrolled it, reading the letter. *Dear Hanna, If you are reading this, then I have failed. We are cursed, and soon it will pass to you.

The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake. The long walk to work provided ample time to daydream about warm meals and deep sleep, luxuries of a distant past. But I didn't have time to daydream today. I couldn't afford to be late. Again.

The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze at, except at significant distance from the sun. This",

        "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

Driving through town was unpleasant experience to say the least, but I had promised my niece she would get that damn sweater she wanted so much. The thought of being bitter about bringing joy to one of the only cool people I know anymore was pretty entertaining to me, made me chuckle to myself at least. She's even worth going out and squinting through that dull winter to go to a place you hate and be around idiots you can't stand. I drove around the parking lot of the mall for about twenty minutes because I slept in for one, eyeing the other latecomers circling around. If it came down to it, I was getting a space, and they could hit my car if they wanted. They weren't going to get much out of me. Finally, about an hour walking distance from the",

With one look at me, he backed away, got in his truck and hurriedly drove on. I waited in the queue for the bus behind an old man who always took his time counting the pennies for the driver. This time I cleared my throat, and when he saw me - he quickly got out of the queue, easily saving everyone five minutes. The bus journey itself was very quick and quiet. The driver himself nervously asked me where it was I wanted to go, and I simply gave him the address of my office. It wasn't even on the bus route, but he obliged. I thanked him",

        "[ PI ] Pripyat's Labyrinth - FebContest Full disclosure: when you mentioned that your story was based on another writing prompt, I went ahead and searched for that thread, thus spoiling the surprise for myself. Whoops.... Anyway, the story was magnificent. The love that Rie and Yeatu share for one another is clear, and the relationship between the brothers provided good motivation for their characters. It wouldn't have been as believable for Rie to run into the Labyrinth to save a business partner, for example. I also did a quick Google search on radiation poisoning, as I don't really know too much about the specifics. Wikipedia has a handy chart that shows which symptoms occur at different levels of radiation, and how long a person has to be exposed before they start showing said symptoms. Rie shows pretty consistent signs of radiation poisoning at around the 2-6 Gy exposure level. I don't know if that's what you were going for, or even if that's an",

He'd taken the crown only ten years previously, but while a sword will get you a crown and a throne, only loyalty will keep you there. Loyalty of the Southern Lords was something Thomas never had, and those lords had seen the ease with which Thomas had taken the crown, and now they wanted it for themselves. Thomas has tried all forms of diplomacy, he'd offered to marry any woman a great Southern Lord had offered him and they refused. He offered gold from the Royal bank and his messages went unanswered. Only in war would he solidify his claim on the throne",

Even though I had no other sensations, I felt a chill come over my whole body as he approached me. \u201c Hello William. I have been waiting for you. \u201d",
        "You are a recently fired police officer in a society where music is outlawed. You accidentally walk into a secret music club. From birth, criminals were one of two things. Those who indulged in great evils, And those who composed them. Music, more known by its legal name \"erroneus rhythm'or \"treasonous cacophony\" Is the ultimate taboo. I won't pretend I know everything about it, but it nearly collapsed the country. In the rebellions of decades past, messages and intelligence was spread through music. Passages, words \"sung\" at different pitches to pass on information. It's my job to make sure it stays gone. At least, it was. Their reason? \"Suspicious action or choice of words involving the nation.\" Needless to say, I haven't quite caught up yet. The rain cascades down in the way it has for years, almost like a chorus of applause to congratulate my failure. I look up and realize that I've",

        "Your powers only work in the rain. The first drop struck my dry forehead. I dabbed the wet spot, rolling the liquid residue between thumb and index finger. My eyes shot up to the sky and I stood, waiting. The smell of freshly dampened grass was unmistakeable with each inhalation. Yet, cascades of water would still be travelling from the heavens to earth. A smirk spread across my face, I glanced down at each arm, goosebumps popped their heads up in excitement. My body shook as a shiver vibrated down my spine. Black circles pulsated on the edge of my vision. The world slowly ebbed in and out in front of me as darkness took over. And then it was all gone. Each eye blinked opened reflexively, as the sun beamed down on my nude body. What had happened? I remember the rain and then being here.",

Brains. I try to remember. Who is she? Brains? A word travels through me. Wife. Brains. Inside, Wife is arguing with Brains. I don't understand their words, but I still hear them. Brains. \"No. My husband isn't even cold.\" \"I don't mean now. But sooner or later...\" \"And how much time do you think we have? We have enough water for like a week tops. \" Water? Tops?

        "The classic Technology vs. Nature story, but twisted on its head. Make the Technology side good and the Nature side evil. \"Burn it!\" The lieutenant screamed. The flame thrower wielding soldier folded down his cracked reflective visor and leveled his weapob at the fungus. A hefty click, and a stream of flame spewed forward, smoke clung to the burning fuel as it flew voraciously toward it's target. However it was too late, the spores had already been released into the atmosphere. The lieutenant peered through his mask and looked up seeing the purple puffs float idly into the sky. His eyes widend into panic. Another soldier fumbled for his radio. She Sqawked \"This is clean up team epsilon, mission failed spores released, permission to retreat over?\" \"Roger that, epsilon process to evacuation point\" the radio replied. The other soldiers sighed heavily through their masks and began to walk through the rest of the landscape, massive pods and molds",
        "This world, but borderless and nationless. (I guess, I have to apologize for this reply, but my first thought for this prompt was: \"Would no Germany mean no Bundesliga?\" and I decided that was exactly what it meant!) The weather on the island was about 50 kinds of shite: Cold, rainy and windy were the first attributes the group noticed when they left the plane and hurried into the relative warmth of the airport. None of them had extra luggage so they immediately made it to the busses. In halting English, the people who lacked tickets rectified that problem with the driver: 3 Sol one way, 5 Sol return trip. Those, who needed sleep caught up on it, assisted by noise cancelling headphones, earplugs or just the superhuman ability",

However this one is odd.He throws a coin on your stash, looks you in the eyes and says \"I have a proposition for you.\" The tiny man walked into my cave, and I almost laughed. I do not say tiny because I am so much larger than humans: He was a legitimately small person. He galloped in with a stuffed horse head on a stick between his legs, taking me by surprise. Normally, the plan was to sneak up on me, or ambush me, but this man was just galloping in noisily with a fake horse - which was a bummer, cause horses are tasty. As I got up and slowly lumbered over to this buffoon, he jumped off of his'horse,' landed with legs spread at a",
        "Daddy, what did you do in the AI War? The moon, mute and bright, hung in a star field unmolseted by city lights. Jayden lay stretched out in a patch of wheat grass. His daughter's warm, small form breathing quietly behind him. Crickets and cicadas, immune to the weight of the moment, trilled and chirped in the still August air. \"Daddy, what happened during the war?\" Jayden hushed his daughter. \"Wait for the transit, Set, just watch\" The moment was only a few minutes away. Once every 3 years, Nephthys, Earth's second, much younger moon would interrupt the moonlight. Its ungainly, geometric form leaving the moon looking unnatural in the early moments of the eclipse. Not many people watched the transit - too many bad memories, too many people lost, but Jayden tried to appreciate it without fear or regret. He wanted his daughter to understand what",
        "Follow-up: You are a compulsive dancer. Anywhere there is music playing you struggle to remain still. The disease began with me. As far as I know, I was the first recorded case of it. In the beginning, friends and family thought it was a joke. The doctors thought me a liar. There was no possible scientific explanation for a disease that would make one dance, of all things, whenever music was heard. It just made no sense. But when we discovered that it was contagious, that I spread the disease wherever I went, the doctors started studying me seriously. Still, at the time it was still just a passing curiosity, and no hindrance to everyday life. The unease began when it turned out that the spread of the disease started to accelerate. The doctors, through careful experimentation, discovered that the disease had a delayed onset upon exposure. That countless many may have caught the disease without displaying the symptoms became cause for concern, and the doctors started",
        "The Town Parade Committee has grown far too powerful. It's up to you to stop them. No one remembers exactly how the thing got so big. Of course, I'm talking about the 4th of July Parade. It started out just like you'd expect, an hour of floats, men in silly hats driving tiny cars, local businesses throwing candy, that sort of thing. There were speeches from the local politicians, picnics, you know. Being a small town, everyone had a good time. But somehow it got bigger. Longer. More floats. More trucks for businesses (some with strange names that no one had ever heard of,) their beds full of the King and Queen of every concept imaginable. More clowns, more funny cars, and worst of all - more Parade Officials. The first year it happened, the Parade went on for hours. The Officials knocked on doors, suggesting that everyone should come watch. Most did. Some didn't. A few never showed up again. But the",

I could smell god forsaken ocean above us, the salt and the water vapor followef you every where you went. With a quick trust of my hand I threw the money on the ground, Nice doing business with ya', was the all he said back to me. Quickly I got the tank and slowly crawled out of",
        "[ CC ] [ PI ] C764 ~ would really appreciate some crit for this piece. I find it a bit difficult to envision the setting. I know it's complicated, but my brain just isn't putting together a good image of what it looks like. It seems like, later in the story, you're describing structures, which doesn't jibe with the concept of cages in my mind. Also, where did the building materials come from? I'm also a bit spotty on the concept of Guilds. What are they? Where did they come from? How many are there? Is everyone in a Guild, or only some people? Do Guilds define the social structure of the caged society? The Shadow is mentioned at the beginning, but kind of falls away after that. Was this intentional, indicating the people are left to their own devices? Maybe you could work the Shadow into a religion or cult of sorts, like"
